# task-two-map
 I followed the pages in the web:
 http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/ 
 from the web i entered the PCsetup from Quick Start Guide and i run all the code in that page
 then from the simulation i run all the code in Gazebo Simulation and SLAM Simulation
 i faced a problem, when i tried to Launch Simulation World the simulation window closed for no reason
 so i solved this problem by using this code:
# $ export SVGA_VGPU10=0
 then i retry to open the simulation and finally it opened correctly
 last thing is that i complete the map by moving the robot using the following keystrokes w s a d
 and then i save the map, that's it.
